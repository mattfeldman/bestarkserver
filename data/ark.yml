  about: >
    We are a **casual PVE ark server** with beginner friendly rates. The server was spawned out of the
    fustration of finding a stable PVE centric community. Our goal was to create an open community of regular ark players. The server is currently based in **Los Angeles, California**


    Our admin philosophy is that we will remove those who are intent on damaging the server, but otherwise do not
    interfere with personal disputes, tribe ownership, lost dinos, spawning items, etc. We believe this hands off approach
    fits the friendly community of our server while giving our staff a chance to focus on important issues and a chance to enjoy ark
    themselves.
